    <summary>Who is setup.md for?</summary>
        <p>
              In short '<strong>everyone</strong>', this project was started so information of value could be collated into a single pane of glass. We're not looking to reinvent the wheel, the goal is to be considered an 'index site' (basically like a search engine) where we will either link to the best articles that already exist on a topic or we will write something from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're backed by many members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/WYYxXBRUwE">Admincraft</a> Discord server, a community that homes over 5,000 members with knowledge that covers a wide range of fields.

    <summary>Are there limitations to the projects scope?</summary>
        <p>
            We are open to any plugin developer(s) adopting setup.md as their knowledgebase repository, if this sounds like something you're interested in raise a PR with a description about your tool.

    <summary>How to request a new feature?</summary>
        <p>
              For this we'd recommend using our <a href="https://smd.gg/discord">Discord server</a>, we utilise the forum channels for clarity and consolidation to a single location. Once enough information has been fed into the channel a project contributor will submit the idea along with supporting comments for documenting, at this stage the initial thread will be locked and closed.
