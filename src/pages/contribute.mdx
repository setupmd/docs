# Contribute to the project

We've tried to make this project as easy to use as possible to help encourage interaction, the information we're looking to cover exists either in our brains, general consensus or the depths of the internet. Our goal is to find, write and upload the relevant high-quality information into a single place.

Before we let you run riot there's a couple of ground rules this page aims to cover. 

### Contribution Guidelines

At this stage of the project the scope is significantly smaller to ensure we cover every area as accurately as possible.

<ul>
    <li><strong>New Articles</strong> - Informational pages and / or complete guides are welcome</li>
    <li><strong>New Plugin Documentation</strong> - Premium and Free plugins are both accepted into the repo</li>
    <li><strong>Document Corrections</strong> - Document corrections can be suggested for any reason</li>
</ul>

We require all contributions to be be completed via a Github PR and should follow our below styling guide.

### Style Guidelines

Currently we request all documents follow our below styling format, you can find an example file <a href="https://github.com/setupmd/templates/blob/main/Docs/blank.md">here</a> which can be downloaded from our templates repository.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title Tags</strong> - For unification, all titles should use the below when it comes to marking up headers</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Headings</strong> - Headings should use a single `#`. No more than one per page</li>
    <li><strong>Sub-Headings</strong> - Subheadings should use either 3 `###`, 4 `####` or 5 `#####` depending on how nested they are. No sub-heading limit per page</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  <p>Example formatting below</p>

  ```md

  ... 

  # Title
  ### Sub-Heading
  #### Sub-Sub-Heading
  #### Sub-Sub-Heading Two
  ##### Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading

  ... 

  ```
<ul>
  <li><strong>Separator Lines</strong> - When using multiple 'three-hash' sub-headings you must use a single line break to signify there is a change within the pages contents</li>
</ul>
<p>Example formatting below</p>

```md
... 

....this is the final sentence of the previous section.

### New Sub-Heading

New topic continued here...

```

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Blocks</strong> - Code blocks must be used when breaking down config files or displaying single lines of code that users are expected to put into a command line</li>
</ul>

```md

...

############################################################
# +------------------------------------------------------+ #
# |                   EssentialsHelp                     | #
# +------------------------------------------------------+ #
############################################################
 
# Show other plugins commands in help.
non-ess-in-help: true
 
# Hide plugins which do not give a permission.
# You can override a true value here for a single plugin by adding a permission to a user/group.
# The individual permission is: essentials.help.(plugin), anyone with essentials.* or '*' will see all help regardless.
# You can use negative permissions to remove access to just a single plugins help if the following is enabled.
hide-permissionless-help: true

...

```

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strikethrough</strong> - Strikethrough can be used to signify redundant information that no longer holds true in the latest release but may still be relevant in previous releases</li>
  <li><strong>Info Blocks</strong> - Info blocks should be used when audience needs their attention drawn to a specific point within the document.</li>
</ul>
