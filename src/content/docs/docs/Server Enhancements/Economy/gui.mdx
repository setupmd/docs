This section takes a look at current plugins that have a user-interface for economy based tasks.


### Active Solutions
Auction & Bidding plugins allow players to list their own items up for sale in a GUI. A necessity for most economy-based servers.

#### AuctionHouse
A decent /ah plugin. Unfortunately, it does have it's fair share of issues. For example, it is one of the most laggiest plugins in every server and also has caused dupes here and there (rare but still possible). 

There are better options out there with far more customizability.

#### PlayerAuctions
It has great levels of customizability and flexibility, to the point where you can edit pretty much every aspect of every single menu. It also has compatibility with lots of other plugins and also an author who is always there to provide support. 

The plugin does however lack in the open source department.

#### PlayerShops (BSP)
It allows every player to create their own shop GUI, similarly to BossShopPro. Players may sell their items in said shop. Might replacement for ChestShops. this plugin hasn't been updated in a while, though.

#### zAuctionHouse
A premium version of Player Auctions. You may find greater performance in addition to a few extra features, notably the Shulker viewer and a Sell inventory but that's about it.

Player Auctions listed in the comparison page says that several features, such as multi-currency support & custom inventories, are not in PA. This is not true as PA does have said features.
