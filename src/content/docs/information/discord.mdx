All project contributors are volunteers and will carry the `project contributor` role within our server.

Those that carry the `project lead` role are the core representatives of the project and should be the ones who are consulted on any issues within.

A permanent invite to our server can be found <a href="http://smd.gg/discord">here</a>.

### Ground Rules

As with any public server, there are some rules that need to be followed.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Be kind to one another</li>
    <li>Don't be an ass, no one is paid to deal with your poor behaviour</li>
    <li>Don't post <strong>any</strong> NSFW content</li>
    <li>Follow the Discord <a href="https://dis.gd/guidelines">community guidelines</a></li>
    <li>Follow the Discord <a href="https://dis.gd/tos">terms of service</a></li>
</ul>
