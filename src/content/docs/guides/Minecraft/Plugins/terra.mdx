The setup.md wiki provides Terra worlds available for download monthly, the principle of this guide can be used in situations with / without our pre-provided files if you wish to generate things for yourself.

Before continuing with configuring Terra we are assuming the following:

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>You are using one of our provided world files</li>
    <li>You are running atleast version 1.20.4</li>
</ul>

Make sure you download one of our maps via our 'Additional Services' page.

/>

You will then need to scroll down to one of the following topic headers to complete setup.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Paper & Forks</li>
    <li>Fabric & Forge</li>
</ul>

### Paper & Forks

Download the latest `.jar` file from the Modrinth page using the link below and add it directly to your `/plugins/` folder inside the server directory.

  description="View Terra's official Modrinth page for downloading the plugin."
  href="https://terra.polydev.org/install/versions.html#bukkit-versions"
/>

You will also need to append the following changes to the end of your `bukkit.yml` file **BEFORE** launching your server, this will ensure your server uses the Terra world gen plugin.

```
...

worlds:
  world:
    generator: Terra:OVERWORLD

...
```

Once this has been complete you can upload and unzip the World.XXXXXXX.zip folder into your server directory. This will automatically extract into a `world` folder and you should be ready to start your server.

Once the server is powered on, check for the three lines highlighted above. If these are displayed that means Terra is responsible for your world and chunk management / generation going forward.

### Fabric & Forge

Download the latest `.jar` file from the Modrinth page using the link below and add it directly to your `/mods/` folder inside the server directory.

<LinkCard
  title="Modrinth"
  description="View Terra's official Modrinth page for downloading the mod."
  href="https://terra.polydev.org/install/versions.html#fabric"
/>

Add the following key to your `server.properties` file **BEFORE** launching your server, this will ensure your server uses the Terra world gen plugin.

```
...

level-type=terra:overworld/overworld

...
```

Once this has been complete you can upload and unzip the World.XXXXXXX.zip folder into your server directory. This will automatically extract into a `world` folder and you should be ready to start your server.
