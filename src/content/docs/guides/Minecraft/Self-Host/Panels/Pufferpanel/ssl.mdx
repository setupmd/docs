# Installing dependencies

:::info
This tutorial will use Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS as the operating system, and Cloudflare as the DNS provider.
:::

To install the dependencies, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

---

# Adding a domain name

For this, we will want to go to Cloudflare, and create an A record for our domain with the name you want and your server's Public IP.

# Setting nginx virtual host

To enable this, we will need to edit the file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pufferpanel.conf`, and we will use nano to edit it. To edit it, run the following command:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pufferpanel.conf
```

And now, you have to add the following:
Remember to change `panel.examplehost.com` to your domain name!


```
server {
         listen 80;
         root /var/www/pufferpanel;

         server_name panel.examplehost.com;

         location ~ ^/\.well-known {
           root /var/www/html;
           allow all;
         }

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
             proxy_http_version 1.1;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             client_max_body_size 100M;
         }
     }
```
If you're using PuTTY, you can right click on the terminal to paste it, and if you're using just a terminal, you can press `Ctrl + Shift + V` to paste it.

To save now, you have to press `Ctrl + X`, and then `Y`.

Now you'll want to restart nginx, to do that, run the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

We also need to open ports 80 and 443, so we can access the panel.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw reload
```

# Enabling SSL

To enable SSL, we will need to run the following command:
```
sudo certbot --nginx -d (yourdomain)
```

And that's it! Now if you go into your browser, and try to go into https://(yourdomain), you should be able to access the panel!
