MiniMOTD is a plugin of which allows you to **fully** customize your server's MOTD by:
* Adding multiple MOTD messages that can alternate between one another,
* Adding RGB gradients,
* Adding Placeholders,
* and much more...,

### Note
Whilst MiniMOTD can run on your backend server, if you are running a network via a proxy such as Bungeecord or Velocity, MiniMOTD will be ran on your proxy. Therefore, you should download MiniMOTD to your proxy rather than your individual servers. If you are just running one singular server, MiniMOTD will run directly on that server.
