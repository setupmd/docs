A premium version of Player Auctions. You may find greater performance in addition to a few extra features, notably the Shulker viewer and a Sell inventory but that's about it.

Player Auctions listed in the comparison page says that several features, such as multi-currency support & custom inventories, are not in PA. This is not true as PA does have said features.
