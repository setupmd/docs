:::info
Throughout this guide 'Anti-Cheat(s)' may be referred to as 'AC' or 'ACs'
:::

ACs are an integral part of any public server and help with catching hackers, since Minecraft's built-in anti-cheat is practically useless, it's better to turn it off than to endure the constant false positives it spews out. 

You should change the following settings within the  `server.properties` file.

```yml
...

allow-flight=true

...
```

Within the `spigot.yml` file you should also set the following values.

```yml
...

     moved-wrongly-threshold: 100000.0
     moved-too-quickly-multiplier: 100000.0
     
...
```

:::warning
We highly discourage the usage of auto-bans as no anti-cheat is perfect. If you want to auto-ban, consider having something like AntiCheatReplay so that you can undo false bans.

#### Astro

##### Pros
  - Great movement and combat checks
  - Good default config
  - Great performance - very light on the main thread. Ate only .01% of ticks at 430 players.
  - Decent Bedrock Checks. Obviously do not auto-ban in case of violations.

##### Cons
  - USD 30.00
  - Timer checks false incredibly often
  - Poor reliability; has broken at least once per quarter so far.
  - Atrocious ToS which states that you are not allowed to mention that your server is using Astro. Also, to purchase the anti-cheat, the server must have an active player count of 50 or above.

#### Polar

##### Pros
  - Great movement and combat checks
  - Works out-of-the-box on most servers
  - Cloud-based detections, which helps reducing stress on server resources

##### Cons
  - Subscription plans starting at EUR 15/month
  - Limitations on player count, server instances and dedicated servers based on subscription plan

### Recommendations

Both Astro and Vulcan offer a great price to performance ratio. However, Astro will be significantly lighter on system resources.
Also, Vulcan will support Bedrock in the near future. Astro already supports it.

:::tip
Remember, no anti-cheat is perfect. Players will be able to bypass anti-cheats, so we recommend having a moderator or two online to keep an eye out for any cheaters.
