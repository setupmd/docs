# Remote Access

Now we have our environment configured, we want to lock down entry points to a single source (via the Sophos firewall). The first thing we will configure is a split tunnel VPN, this will ensure only traffic destined for the remote network is sent via the VPN. To prevent opening our Proxmox environment to the internet directly we will configure a software based KVM solution for those who want UI access to their VPS via a web browser.


### Firewall Configuration 

This guide will assume you are already logged into the firewall and the out of box experience has been completed as per the previous articles.

#### Configuring ACL

The below rules will allow for cross network communication between the VPN subnet (10.81.0.0/24) and the LAN subnet (172.16.16.0/24).

### Accessing the Network

You will now be able to login to the user portal which is located at https://publicip:443 / https://publicip:8443, this can be changed under the Administration tab within the firewall if needed.

Once logged into the portal you can go to the 'VPN' tab and download the Sophos Connect Client and the SSL VPN Configuration file.
