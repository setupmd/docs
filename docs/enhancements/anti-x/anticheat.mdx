# Anti-Cheat

:::info
Throughout this guide 'Anti-Cheat(s)' may be referred to as 'AC' or 'ACs'
:::

ACs are an integral part of any public server and help with catching hackers, since Minecraft's built-in anti-cheat is practically useless, it's better to turn it off than to endure the constant false positives it spews out. 

You should change the following settings within the  `server.properties` file.

```yml
...

allow-flight=true

...
```

Within the `spigot.yml` file you should also set the following values.

```yml
...

     moved-wrongly-threshold: 100000.0
     moved-too-quickly-multiplier: 100000.0
     
...
```

For the recommended anti-xray settings [click here](./ax).

:::warning
We highly discourage the usage of auto-bans as no anti-cheat is perfect. If you want to auto-ban, consider having something like AntiCheatReplay so that you can undo false bans.

#### Polar

##### Pros
  - Great movement and combat checks
  - Works out-of-the-box on most servers
  - Cloud-based detections, which helps reducing stress on server resources

### Recommendations

Both Astro and Vulcan offer a great price to performance ratio however the key trade-off are Astro will be slightly lighter on system resources while Vulcan has better checks and will support Bedrock in the near future. 

If you're looking for a Geyser anti-cheat and will tollerate poor performance at larger player counts consider using Spartan Bedrock Edition (or waiting for Vulcan V3).

:::tip
Remember, no anti-cheat is perfect. Players will be able to bypass anti-cheats, so we recommend having a moderator or two online to keep an eye out for any cheaters.
