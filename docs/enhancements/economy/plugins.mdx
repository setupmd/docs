# Economy Plugins

An Economy-based server usually has plugins such as /shop (Server), /auctionhouse, /chestshops etc. A list of good plugins for each category is as below.

### Requirements
Most, if not all plugins require your server to have an Economy API (such as [Vault](/enhancements/plugins/vault)) and an Economy Handler (Such as TheNewEconomy) installed. A short list of handlers is below:
  * EssentialsX
  * TheNewEconomy (Optional Vault Support)
  * iConomy
  * Gringott's Economy

### /shop Plugins
/shop Plugins are server-sided shops, meaning that all items are bought and sold from and to the the server instead of a player.

#### [ShopGUI+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/shopgui-1-8-1-19.6515/)
ShopGUI+ is probably the most well known /shop plugin out there. Kitted out with basically every feature you might need (other than a dynamically evolving economy), it is a pretty solid choice for most servers.
Too bad that it's 18 USD and performs poorly when scaled to higher player counts. Only worth buying if you want support for other plugins.

#### [BossShopPro](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshoppro-the-most-powerful-chest-gui-shop-menu-plugin.222/)
Solid /shop plugin with a lot of good features. I highly recommend that you find a fork to download instead of using the old SpigotMC version.

#### [EconomyShopGUI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/economyshopgui.69927/)
Free, simple /shop plugin that just does the job. It also has a premium version for 12 USD. Free version is extremely limiting.

#### [DeluxeMenus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxemenus.11734/)
Now hear me out.. I know that DeluxeMenus isn't exactly a server-shop plugin, but it is nearly perfect for the job since it is EXTREMELY flexible. cj89898 has made a wonderful DeluxeMenus shop [here](https://github.com/cj89898/DeluxeMenus-DeluxeShop). You may also use my (much simpler) version [here](https://github.com/setupmd/templates/raw/main/Plugin%20Configurations/deluxemenusshop.zip)

### Player GUI Shop Plugins
Auction & Bidding plugins allow players to list their own items up for sale in a GUI. A necessity for most economy-based servers.

#### [AuctionHouse](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/auctionhouse.61836/)
A decent /ah plugin. Unfortunately, it does have it's fair share of issues. For example, it is one of the most laggiest plugins in every server I've seen and also has caused dupes here and there (Rare, though.). There are better options out there with far more customizability.

#### [PlayerAuctions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/83073/)
Easily the best /ah plugin I've ever used. It has extreme levels of customizability and flexibility, to the point where you can edit pretty much every aspect of every single menu. It also has compatibility with lots of other plugins and also an amazing author who is always there to provide support. Only issue it has at the very moment is that it isn't open source. Highly recommend it as long as you don't mind it being close sourced.

#### [PlayerShops (BSP)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playershops-gui-bsp-allow-players-to-create-public-shops.29568/)
It allows every player to create their own shop GUI, similarly to BossShopPro. Players may sell their items in said shop. Might replacement for ChestShops. this plugin hasn't been updated in a while, though. Look for an updated fork instead.

#### [zAuctionHouse](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-1-19-zauctionhouse-1200-servers-online.63010/)
Player Auctions, but paid. Might have better performance than PA and a couple extra features, notably the Shulker viewer and a Sell inventory, but that's about it. Also, Player Auctions listed in the comparison page says that several features, such as multi-currency support & custom inventories, are not in PA. This is not true as PA does have said features.

### Chest Shops

#### [QuickShop](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quickshop-reremake-1-19-ready-multi-currency.62575/)
Easily the best Chest Shop plugin, containing pretty much every feature you might need. I highly recommend that you use this.

#### [ChestShop](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestshop.51856/)
A simpler chest shop plugin that still has plenty of solid features. Also a very good choice.

#### [DukesMart](https://github.com/jianbriggs/DukesMart)
Super basic Chest Shop plugin which uses Gold Ingots as a currency. Terra-Opus is making a fork with a couple good changes so that might be worth checking out.
