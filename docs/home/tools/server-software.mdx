# Server Software

When creating a server there will be multiple different names you come across, each server software (also referred to as a server jar) has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

Server Software might be referred to as "Server Engine" or "Server Jar".

:::note 
A "Fork" is basically a modfified version of a previous variant, they will normally share the same codebase and will often patch in their own changes on top of the previous projects code.

### Backend Servers

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of different forks, this document will only include recommended stable jars.

#### [Vanilla](https://getbukkit.org/download/vanilla)

As the name suggests, it is a completely Vanilla server from Mojang itself without any modifications. Great for those who want to host a small server for a couple of friends without altering any mechanics, but definitely not good for large servers. It uses datapacks instead of plugins.

#### [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads)

Paper is the most popular Server Jar these days. A fork of Spigot with it's own API, tons of glitch/dupe fixes alongside the numerous optimizations, Paper is the optimal choice for most server owners.

#### [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/downloads)

A fork of Paper which is made for providing numerous gameplay-enhancing features without having to download/create plugins. Only has a couple of optimization options, but it does allow you to toggle some dupes.

#### Legacy 1.8 Jars

It is highly recommended that you do not use 1.8 or any of it's point releases however if it's a requirement for whatever reason these are the better jars to use.

 - [BurritoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/BurritoSpigot)
 - [SportPaper](https://github.com/Electroid/SportPaper)
 - [PandaSpigot](https://github.com/hpfxd/PandaSpigot)
 - [WindSpigot](https://github.com/Wind-Development/WindSpigot)

#### [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)

Forge is a modding API and server jar. It is most commonly used for servers with large modpacks. However, it is not very optimized and suffers from poor performance.

#### [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)

Fabric is similar to forge (but not a fork) in the sense that it also supports mods. These mods can change practically every mechanic of the game. Fabric also has a great amount of optimization mods such as Lithium, Starlight, Phosphor etc. Take a look at [this list](https://github.com/NordicGamerFE/usefulmods)

#### Any Jar that combines Plugins & Mods

Do not use any server software such as Magma or Mohist. These are generally unstable. [Mohist also replaces EssentialsX jars with modified jars](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html), which might not be safe.

### Proxies

Proxies are used to connect multiple Normal Servers (such as Spigot servers) together. It is used by servers which have multiple gamemodes i.e. Survival, Minigames and Prison etc.

#### [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall)

A fork of Bungeecord run by the Paper guys, Waterfall also supports most, if not all Bungeecord plugins. It also comes with a couple of networking optimizations. Probably the go-to jar for most people.

#### [Velocity](https://papermc.io/downloads#Velocity)

A more recent project, also run by the lads at Paper. Velocity uses it's own API and does not work with Bungeecord (Unless you use SNAP!, which allows you to use Bungeecord plugins on Velocity. Not recommended, though.) Velocity is pretty much a superior version of Bungeecord & Waterfall (unless you're hosting <1.13 servers.) However, most developers haven't bothered adding Velocity support to their plugins.
