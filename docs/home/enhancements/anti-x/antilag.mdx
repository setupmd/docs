# Anti-Lag

Below is a list of tools and optimisations you can use to identify and mitigate TPS (server) lag.

:::warning
It is not recommended to use anti-lag plugins such as ClearLagg - the biggest thing it does is periodically clear dropped items at a set interval - this makes a negligible difference to lag. Most anti-lag plugins have poor detection that in the worst case may cause more lag on top of what you already have, as well as hiding performance issues under a thin veil rather than actually fixing them
