### Other Providers 

Yes, there are other great providers that haven't made our list for one reason or another - if you do decide to venture out and search for other providers some things we'd recommend you looking out for are 

#### Avoid These Things

- Don't use a host that makes you pay with a 'per-player slot' model - This is awfully dated and you should focus on resource based pricing instead.
- Don't use Mojang (Microsoft) Realms - This is an Azure backed platform designed for bedrock but also has Java presence, in the long run you will not have an enjoyable experience.
- Don't use a host that appears on a 'drama site' / forum - Hosts that make these lists tend to be awfully run and you'll have a bad time with them.

#### Look For These Things
- Do your own research, check the companies trustpilot reviews etc to get an understanding of how the customers feel.
- Look for hosts that advertise hardware components and don't make you dig through pages of docs to get the information.
- Check the providers status page for a better understanding of reliability

<strong> If in doubt ASK! Measure twice and cut once.</strong>
