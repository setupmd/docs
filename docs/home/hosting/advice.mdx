# Chosing a Provider

This page is here as a reference point for the good and the bad hosting providers within the Minecraft scene. We're specifically focusing on 'Minecraft hosting' so providers that focus primarily on VPS, Bare Metal or other cloud service providers should not be entered onto this list.

These are hosts that you will normally have a great experience with, we sort the hosts in alphabetical order and not representiative of our preference.

### Hosts you should consider

#### EnviroMC

EnviroMC is a quality Minecraft service provider that focuses on both the budget and high-end requirements of their customers, as of Sept. 19th 2022 URHOST clients will be absorbed into EnviroMC as part of a takeover agreement.

#### URHOST

URHOST is no longer accepting signups in the preperation for migration to EnviroMC, a service provider that focused on bringing high-end hardware with the lowest possible pricing.
