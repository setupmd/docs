### Hosts you should avoid

#### Any host that charges for player slots

Charging for player slots is an archaic method of sale still used by some older hosts today to try and get more money from your servers. Look for hosts that charge per gigabyte of RAM instead, such as the ones mentioned above.  
Examples include Scalacube and ZAP-Hosting

#### ApexMinecraftHosting

This host is not recommended for more experienced server admins, their high price is usually attributed to the almost managed nature of the servers

#### ConsulHosting

Attempted to sue the owner of a popular survival server over a bandwidth limit that they didn't disclose

#### gamehosted.net

Known as a "summer host" by the community, their support handles issues with subusers very poorly - they recommend to give out your main panel credentials 

#### MCProHosting

Poor hardware for the price

#### Minecraft Realms

* Very limited control over your server - cannot change settings, render distance is forced to 6
* Chat is monitored by Mojang, which may not be to your liking - the controversial profanity filter is enabled by default
* Poor value, charges $7.99USD for 10 player slots
* Poor hardware resulting in frequent lag on larger Realms

#### ReviveNode

Support may tell you to delete your world if you ever come across memory issues

#### Shockbyte

Known for overselling hardware - this means to sell more CPU and memory than what is available on their nodes to extract more money out of users
