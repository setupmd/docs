### Hosts you should avoid

#### Any host that charges for player slots

Charging for player slots is an archaic method of sale still used by some older hosts today to try and get more money from your servers. Look for hosts that charge per gigabyte of RAM instead, such as the ones mentioned above.  

Examples of per-slot hosting include (but not limited to) Nitrado, Scalacube and ZAP-Hosting.

#### ConsulHosting

Dutch hosting provider with questionable business practices that invovles (but not limited to) legal threats.

#### gamehosted.net

Low reputation host with questionable business practices and poor regards for user data / personal information e.g. account credentials.

#### MCProHosting

A legacy hosting provider that unfortunately hasn't adapted with the times very well leading to poor hardware for an extortionate price.

#### Minecraft Realms

* Very limited control over your server - cannot change settings, render distance is forced to 6
* Chat is monitored by Mojang, which may not be to your liking - the controversial profanity filter is enabled by default
* Poor value, charges $7.99USD for 10 player slots
* Poor hardware resulting in frequent lag on larger Realms

#### ReviveNode

A hosting provider with poor user support and misinformation within support tickets.

#### Shockbyte

A low-end hosting provider with heavy overselling of resources leading to poor performance.
