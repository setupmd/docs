# Chosing a Provider

This page is here as a reference point for the good and the bad hosting providers within the Minecraft scene. We're specifically focusing on 'Minecraft hosting' so providers that focus primarily on VPS, Bare Metal or other cloud service providers should not be entered onto this list.

These are hosts that you will normally have a great experience with, we sort the hosts in alphabetical order and not representiative of our preference.

### Hosts you should consider

#### EnviroMC

EnviroMC is a quality Minecraft service provider that focuses on both the budget and high-end requirements of their customers, as of Sept. 19th 2022 URHOST clients will be absorbed into EnviroMC as part of a takeover agreement.

#### URHOST

URHOST is no longer accepting signups in the preperation for migration to EnviroMC, a service provider that focused on bringing high-end hardware with the lowest possible pricing.

#### Bloom.host

Unparalleled price to performance with dedicated resources on high-end AMD Ryzen hardware and a bespoke customised version of the Pterodactyl panel

### Hosts you should avoid

#### Any host that charges for player slots

Charging for player slots is an archaic method of sale still used by some older hosts today to try and get more money from your servers. Look for hosts that charge per gigabyte of RAM instead, such as the ones mentioned above.  
Examples include Scalacube and ZAP-Hosting

#### Minecraft Realms

* Very limited control over your server - cannot change settings, render distance is forced to 6
* Chat is monitored by Mojang, which may not be to your liking - the controversial profanity filter is enabled by default
* Poor value, charges $7.99USD for 10 player slots
* Poor hardware resulting in frequent lag on larger Realms

#### ReviveNode

Support may tell you to delete your world if you ever come across memory issues

#### ApexMinecraftHosting

This host is not recommended for more experienced server admins, their high price is usually attributed to the almost managed nature of the servers

#### MCProHosting

Similar reason to Apex Hosting

#### Shockbyte

Known for overselling hardware - this means to sell more CPU and memory than what is available on their nodes to extract more money out of users

#### gamehosted.net

Known as a "summer host" by the community, their support handles issues with subusers very poorly - they recommend to give out your main panel credentials 

#### ConsulHosting

Attempted to sue the owner of [ChickenCraft](https://shop.chickencraft.nl/), a popular survival server, over a bandwidth limit that they didn't disclose
