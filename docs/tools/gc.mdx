# Java Garbage Collection

Over the years, Java has implemented different garbage collectors.

## Concurrent Mark Sweep

This early Java garbage collector was introduced to the HotSpot JVM on version 1.4.1, using [naive mark-and-sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na%C3%AFve_mark-and-sweep) garbage collection.

It was deprecated in Java 9 and could be enabled with the `-XX:EnableConcMarkSweepGC` JVM flag up until Java 14.

## Garbage-First (G1GC)

The most popular garbage collector among Minecraft developers, the generational G1 garbage collector was added to Java 7 and made default in Java 9 - it aimed to lower pause times with concurrent and parallel phases.
To use it in Java 7-8, pass `-XX:+UseG1GC` to your JVM flags.

PaperMC core team member Aikar has curated a set of flags that tunes G1 to its maximum performance, you can find them [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags)

**Memory**

For optimal performance, make your Xms (minimum heap) equal to your Xmx (maximum heap)

### Shenandoah

Shenandoah is a relatively new garbage collector introduced in Java 12 that aims to further improve on G1's pause times by collecting garbage concurrently with the program - pause times are thus no longer proportional to the heap size

Developer Hilltty has created a set of Shenandoah flags using large pages to increase responsiveness, which you can find [here](https://github.com/hilltty/hilltty-flags/blob/main/english-lang.md)

### ZGC

An experimental, almost fully concurrent garbage collector introduced with Java 11 and improved with Java 13+, ZGC aims for the following:
* Sub-millisecond pause times that do not grow with heap size
* Handling of heaps 8MB-16TB in size

[Here](https://krusic22.com/2020/03/25/higher-performance-crafting-using-jdk11-and-zgc/) is a tick-accurate comparison between the performance of the G1 and Z garbage collectors.
