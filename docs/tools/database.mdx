# Databases

Before you go and implement a database you should first understand what a database can help to achieve, this will ensure that you're not burning time unnecessarily deploying things you don't need.

### Why use databases

Databases are used for centralised storage with unrestricted limitations to read, write new data and modify existing data. Storing data in a database can also be efficient, decreases time for looking up data that you can export into another application / format without significant difficulty.

### When to use a database

In a Minecraft environment you're most likely going to come across databases in a 'Network' environment e.g. when you're using a tool such as ['Velocity'](/t/server-software#velocity), or ['Bungee'](/t/server-software#bungeecord), this will allow you to share information between your backend servers and have one consistent dataset e.g. economy balances, synced ranks and permissions etc just to name a few examples. 
If you're running a server with a hosting provider they too will most likely give you the ability to create databases for your plugin data as this gives them greater availability and performance at scale.
