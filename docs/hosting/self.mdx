# Self Hosting 

When it comes to running everything yourself you have two options

- Rent hardware / compute in the 'cloud'
- Provide your own hardware and run at a datacentre / your house 

Before you decide on one vs the other, they both have their pros and cons that you should be aware of before coming to a final conclusion.
