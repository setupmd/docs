# Proxying Dynmap with Nginx

This tutorial covers how to proxy your Dynmap server behind Nginx with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt installed

### You Will Need

* A Minecraft server with Dynmap installed - see the previous page
* Root access to your proxy server

This tutorial assumes we are using Ubuntu 22.04 as the server OS and UFW as our firewall. Let's get started!

### Reverse Proxy Setup

#### Installing Nginx

First off, we need to install Nginx, Certbot and allow HTTP access

```
cobalt@proxy-server:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx ufw -y
...
cobalt@proxy-server:~$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' && sudo ufw enable
```


#### Configuration File

Below is an example configuration file. Edit it and save it as `/etc/nginx/sites-available/dynmap`
```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/dynmap
server {
  server_name map.yourdomain.com # change me
  listen 80;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8123/; # change me
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}
```

Enable the site and restart Nginx:
```bash
cobalt@proxy-server:~$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dynmap /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dynmap
cobalt@proxy-server:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### SSL Certificate Deployment

We should be able to access our proxied map: type `http://map.yourdomain.com` into your web browser - if the Dynmap webpage shows up then huzzah!  
Now all we need to do is set up an SSL certificate to secure our Dynmap - it's easy as 1, 2, 3!
```bash
cobalt@proxy-server:~$ sudo certbot --nginx --agree-tos --no-eff-email -m johndoe@example.com -d map.yourdomain.com
...
```
With that, you should be done! Just to be sure, restart Nginx to apply the configuration changes.  
Now we should be able to access our secured Dynmap - type `https://map.yourdomain.com` into your web browser - if no SSL errors show up and the padlock is present in the URL bar, then you're all done!
