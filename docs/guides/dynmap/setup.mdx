# Installing Dynmap

This page details the setup process for the Dynmap plugin, assuming the Paper Minecraft server is being used and Dynmap's internal web server is being used.

### You Will Need

* A Minecraft server with Spigot or any of its forks
* A secondary port allocation for the web server to listen on if you are using a shared host

---

### Installation

First things first, we need to install the Dynmap plugin on our server. Download it from [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/) and upload it to `/plugins` on your server, whether through (S)FTP or the web. Restart your server and go to `/plugins/dynmap`.

#### Configuring Dynmap

Once you're in the Dynmap plugin directory, we'll need to tweak the `configuration.txt` file a bit. Open it with your favourite text editor or web editor.

* To adjust the resolution of tiles, find the line that says `deftemplatesuffix` - this'll be the first thing you see when you open up the file - change it to one of [`vlowres`, `lowres`, `medres`, `hires`]
:::warning
Fully-generated high resolution maps will take up to hundreds of gigabytes of disk space
:::
* To use an SQL database for map storage rather than flat files, comment `type: filetree` and uncomment `#type: sqlite` or `#type: mysql` along with the filename for SQLite or MySQL credentials depending on which you are using.
Alternatively, you can use Amazon S3 for storing maps, uncomment the lines below `# AWS S3 bucket web site` and change the region and access credentials to match yours
* To customise the title of the webpage, uncomment the line containing `webpage-title` and change the value as you wish.
* To save on disk space for  while preserving most quality of tile images, find the line that begins with `image-format` and set it to `jpg-q90`. Alternatively, you can use the more efficient WEBP format - make sure to also uncomment the `cwebpPath` and `dwebpPath` lines as well as installing the appropriate packages
* To enable the outbound web server, find the line that says `webserver-bindaddress` and uncomment it. Change the `webserver-port` to whatever port you plan to use - if you're on a host with a shared IP, this'll be something way different from the default `8123`. This is practically a must for this guide as it's the whole point - unless you want to use an external web server, which isn't covered here.
* To enable login support, change `login-enabled` to true - change `login-required` to true to require login for access
* To require login for the webchat, go back up and find the line that says `webchat-requires-login` - uncomment and change to true.
:::note
If you plan to use the login system, SSL is a must to encrypt traffic between users and the web server - unencrypted logins are prone to attacks from hackers. The next page contains a tutorial on how to do this

Restart your Minecraft server to apply the changes. When done, type `http://<server-ip>:<dynmap-port>` into your web browser - if a webpage shows up, then ta-da! Dynmap's internal web server is working fine and dandy!
