# Installation

:::info
This tutorial will use Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS as the operating system and UFW as the firewall.
:::

To install PufferPanel, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
# Update the system packages
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Add the PufferPanel repository
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/pufferpanel/pufferpanel/script.deb.sh | sudo bash 

# Download and install PufferPanel using apt
sudo apt install pufferpanel

# Enable PufferPanel
sudo systemctl enable pufferpanel
```

---

# Port forwarding

After the installation is complete, you will need to configure your firewall.

```bash
# Open ports 8080, 5657 and 22 for Web access, SSH and SFTP 
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
sudo ufw allow 5657/tcp
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

You will also need to add those ports to your ingress rules in your hosting provider.

---

# Adding the admin user

To add the admin user, you will need to run the following command:

```bash
sudo pufferpanel user add
```

And the base installation is done, now connect to the panel with http://(Your server's Public IP Address):8080/ and login with the account you've created.
