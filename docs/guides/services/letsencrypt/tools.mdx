# Tools

Firstly you need to look out for what service you wish to protect, this will depend on the product available to use. Once you have identified what needs to be protected then you can then pick the right tool.

### Web Services 

If you're accessing the service via a web-browser then this part of the page will be for you, this will not cover successful deployment tutorials - we may decide to include this at a later time.

#### Cloudflare 

Cloudflare is the EASIEST and most commonly adopted tool by companies all over the globe, they'll proxy all HTTP and HTTPS traffic over common ports AND can run HTTPS from the client to Cloudflare and then HTTP to your backend if such a solution is needed.

#### Nginx Proxy Manager

Similar to Cloudflare but without the additional DDoS protection as this is a self-hosted Docker solution that can be used to generate valid trusted ssl certificates and reverse proxy connections as needed, in combination with a custom DNS server this could be a perfect tool to get an internal domain and SSL functional.

### Linux

This is for tools suitable for generating certificates but perhaps might not be solely for web-servers.

#### Certbot

Certbot is a tool that can be deployed either as a Snap package or a Python module and is designed purely for generating valid Let's Encrypt certificates, their website shows a few dropdown options that when selected will show you the easiest way for deployment. You will be able to use these certficates for any service, website or platform that will allow for the uploading of custom certificates.
