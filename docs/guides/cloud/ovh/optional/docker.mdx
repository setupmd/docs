# Docker 

The purpose of this document is to outline the build of our Docker LXC that we use internally to host our services and manage them with Portainer. While for us Docker is a core essential part of our network everything completed in our Lab tutorials can be put in it's own Virtual Machine without too much more additional effort minus system management.

### VM Configuration

We're using the following hardware configuration which will be more than enough, we will be using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as our base operating system.

- Threads - '2'
- RAM - '3GB'
- Block Storage - '30GB'
- Network Interface - 'vmbr1'

This VM is created in the same way all the others have been in [the previous guide](/guides/lab/vms#creating-the-vm-1), you can use this for reference if needed.

### Optional Configuration 

While not required we will complete the following additional steps, deploying Azure Arc and hardening the OS.

#### Device hardening

You should follow the guide posted [here](/guides/lab/hardening#ubuntu-script) which explains what the script does at a high level as well as providing links to download them.

#### Azure Arc 

We utilise Arc for patch maintenance, if you already have an RMM this functionality is already most likely available to you and you should use that instead. To automate patch management you firstly need to sign up for an Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/account/sign_up).

It's super easy first you need to define a patch maintenance schedule (these can be assigned to as many devices as you like)
