Permission manager plugins allow you to define groups (ranks), and permission levels for all of your players on your server.

### Examples

We have collated a small list of plugins you can use to get you started with on your Minecraft server below.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>[LuckPerms](/e/pl/luckperms)</li>
    <li>[PowerRanks](/e/pl/powerranks)</li>
</ul>
