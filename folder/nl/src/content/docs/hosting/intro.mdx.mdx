If you're looking to run a Minecraft server of your own there are multiple things you should consider.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Where do you want to host it?</li>
    <li>How do you want to host it?</li>
    <li>Do you want the ability to be able to host more than Minecraft?</li>
</ul>

Our goal is to cover all of this and offer our own recommendations on providers you can use for all possibilities, some key articles can be found below.
