When you're setting up a new server, a very important part of the process is managing permissions and **configuring them as you go**. 

Permissions are little pieces of text that indicate an action. When you grant a certain group of players this permission, the plugin will know that they are allowed to perform this action. They are usually laid out like `pluginname.permission`.  

An example is the `essentials.afk` permission. If you give this permission to a player, they will be able to perform the `/afk` command.

:::note
You can use the wildcard (`*`) operator to indicate everything when supplying a permission.
Ex: `essentials.*` will give you every permission that starts with `essentials.`.

It is a very bad idea to give someone (even yourself!) either the `*` or `*.*` permission(s).

So how does one grant permissions to their players? For this exact purpose people have created permission plugins. They allow you to create groups, usually associated with the term Rank. You can then give certain permissions to these groups, and assign players to these groups.
