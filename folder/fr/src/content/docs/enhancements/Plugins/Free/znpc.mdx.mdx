### ZNPCs

ZNPCs is another popular NPC plugin. Although it is better than Citizens from a performance perspective, it is quite janky and unpleasant to setup.

### ZNPCsPlus

ZNPCsPlus delivers great performance while also being easy to setup & edit. Recommended as long as you don't mind the lack of support in other plugins for it, V2 can be compiled from the Github page.
