The Vault API is the longest standing, most reliable permissions, chat and economy API backbone for Minecraft. It's been around for about a decade at this point in time and with every update that passes reliability has always remained.

Vault is a plugin that once added will rarely need updating and with a lot of plugins requiring it, you should make sure it's first on your download list!
