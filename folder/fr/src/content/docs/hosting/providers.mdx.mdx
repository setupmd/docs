### Other Providers

Yes, there are other great providers that haven't made our list for one reason or another - if you do decide to venture out and search for other providers some things we'd recommend you looking out for are

#### Avoid These Things

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Don't use a host that makes you pay with a 'per-player slot' model - This is awfully dated and you should focus on resource based pricing instead</li>
    <li>Don't use Mojang (Microsoft) Realms - This is an Azure backed platform designed for bedrock but also has Java presence, in the long run you will not have an enjoyable experience</li>
    <li>Don't use a host that appears on a 'drama site' / forum - Hosts that make these lists tend to be awfully run and you'll have a bad time with them</li>
</ul>
#### Look For These Things
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Do your own research, check the companies TrustPilot reviews etc to get an understanding of how the customers feel</li>
    <li>Look for hosts that advertise hardware components and don't make you dig through pages of docs to get the information</li>
    <li>Check the providers status page for a better understanding of reliability</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong> If in doubt ASK! Measure twice and cut once.</strong>
