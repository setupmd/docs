When it comes to running everything yourself you have two options

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Rent hardware / compute in the 'cloud'</li>
    <li>Provide your own hardware and run at a data centre / your house</li>
</ul>

### Option 1

If you can afford it, this is your better option. While this is the most expensive option your monthly bill does include hardware, electricity, internet and in some cases ddos protection. A mid-range to high end service will cost you anywhere from 100$ per month in this regards so may not be suitable for those who don't already have an established community, we discuss this option a in a bit more depth [here](/h/types#bare-metal--vds).

### Option 2

The cheapest option but is does require some additional thought however for one or two people this option may still make the most sense.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Do you have a suitable internet connection? Firstly run a speed test, this will give you an idea of where your current connection sits. A 50mbps connection for both upload and download should be sufficient for your regular household activities **and** your Minecraft server, remember your connection is shared between all devices so downloading something on your internet e.g. steam games will reduce the available connection to Minecraft.</li>
    <li>Do you have proper IPv4 addresses? Yes, Minecraft *can* support IPv6 but it requires all parties involved to also support V6 connectivity. You also need to consider if you have a [static IPv4 address](/ts/ip).</li>
    <li>Have you considered the overhead to security, power utilisation, heat generated, noise produced and cost of hardware? Protecting the rest of your network can cost you either in man-hours or hardware if you need to purchase additional tools to get operational. This should all be considered before you commit to running things from home.</li>
    <li>24/7 Availability? If you're not prepared to run a server 24/7 from your home are you players happy with the fact a server will only be online for a few hours a day.</li>
</ul>

If you do want to host things yourself we have documentation on how to do such things [here](/guides/self-host).
